I'm a second year Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering at the University of Maryland, College Park, working under the supervision of Professor [Ang Li](https://www.ang-li.com/) in the [CASE Lab](https://www.ang-li.com/lab/). Previously, I got my B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Sharif University of Technology.

My research focuses on efficient deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on resource-constrained devices. Specifically, I am interested in model compression techniques such as quantization and pruning to enable scalable inference while maintaining model performance. My work aims to bridge the gap between powerful foundation models and practical edge deployment, contributing to collaborative and efficient AI systems.
