I'm a second year Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering at the University of Maryland, College Park, working under the supervision of Professor [Ang Li](https://www.ang-li.com/) in the [CASE Lab](https://www.ang-li.com/lab/). Previously, I got my B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Sharif University of Technology

My research is dedicated to building trustworthy, safety-critical AI systems that people can rely on.
